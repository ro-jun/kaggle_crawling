        "data_description": "Context\nAlthough there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.\nContent\nThe project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The individual data files have been merged together into a single data-set. On initial visual inspection of the data showed some missing values. As the data-sets were from WHO, we found no evident errors. Missing data was handled in R software by using Missmap command. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde etc. Finding all data for these countries was difficult and hence, it was decided that we exclude these countries from the final model data-set. The final merged file(final dataset) consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables was then divided into several broad categories:Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors."

Detection of laundering is very difficult. Most automated algorithms have a high false positive rate: legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as laundering. The converse is also a major problem -- false negatives, i.e. undetected laundering transactions. Naturally, criminals work hard to cover their tracks.\nAccess to real financial transaction data is highly restricted -- for both proprietary and privacy reasons. Even when access is possible, it is problematic to provide a correct tag (laundering or legitimate) to each transaction -- as noted above. This from IBM avoids these problems."

They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse take many forms.

Its intresting to see application of AI to assist clinicians during patient treatment in a privacy preserving way. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support patients during the care process.\nOffline Reinforcement learning (also referred to as safe or batch reinforcement learning) is a promising sub-field of RL which provides us with a mechanism for solving real world sequential decision making problems where access to simulator is not available. Here we assume that learn a policy from fixed dataset of trajectories with further interaction with the environment(agent doesn't receive reward or punishment signal from the environment). It has shown that such an approach can leverage vast amount of existing logged data (in the form of previous interactions with the environment) and can outperform supervised learning approaches or heuristic based policies for solving real world - decision making problems. Offline RL algorithms when trained on sufficiently large and diverse offline datasets can produce close to optimal policies(ability to generalize beyond training data).\nAs Part of my PhD, research, I investigated the problem of developing a Clinical Decision Support System for Sepsis Management using Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning.\nMIMIC-III ('Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care') is a large open-access anonymized single-center database which consists of comprehensive clinical data of 61,532 critical care admissions from 2001–2012 collected at a Boston teaching hospital.

It manifests itself through a deterioration of movement, including the presence of tremors and stiffness. There is commonly a marked effect on speech, including dysarthria (difficulty articulating sounds), hypophonia (lowered volume), and monotone (reduced pitch range). Additionally, cognitive impairments and changes in mood can occur, and risk of\ndementia is increased.\nTraditional diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease involves a clinician taking a neurological history of the patient and observing motor skills in various situations. Since there is no definitive laboratory test to diagnose PD, diagnosis is often difficult, particularly in the early stages when motor effects are not yet severe. Monitoring progression of the disease over time requires repeated clinic visits by the patient. An effective screening process, particularly one that doesn’t require a clinic visit, would be beneficial. Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. If machine learning algorithms could be applied to a voice recording dataset to accurately diagnosis PD, this would be an effective screening step prior to an appointment with a clinician.\nData"
