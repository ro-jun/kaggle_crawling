This paper presents Flickr30k Entities, which augments the 158k captions from Flickr30k with 244k coreference chains, linking mentions of the same entities across different captions for the same image, and associating them with 276k manually annotated bounding boxes. Such annotations are essential for continued progress in automatic image description and grounded language understanding. They enable us to define a new benchmark for localization of textual entity mentions in an image. We present a strong baseline for this task that combines an image-text embedding, detectors for common objects, a color classifier, and a bias towards selecting larger objects. While our baseline rivals in accuracy more complex state-of-the-art models, we show that its gains cannot be easily parlayed into improvements on such tasks as image-sentence retrieval, thus underlining the limitations of current methods and the need for further research."

Additionally, features like the feeling of guilt or worthlessness, reduced energy, concentration problems, suicidality and psychotic symptoms might be present. The severity of a depression is determined by the quantity of symptoms, their seriousness and duration, as well as the consequences on social and occupational function. Depressions are also common in Bipolar disorder, another severe psychiatric disorder. The main difference between uni-polar depression and bipolar disorder is the periodic occurrence of mania in the latter, a state associated with inﬂated self-esteem, impulsivity, increased activity, reduced sleep and goal-directed actions. Both diseases are genetic disorders, and might be understood as a genetic vulnerability to the environment disturbing the internal biological state and potentially trigger mood episodes. Depression is associated with disrupted biological rhythms caused by environmental disturbance like seasonal change in daylight, alteration of social rhythms due to for instance shift-work or longitude traveling; besides linked to lifestyles associated with diurnal rhythms inconsistent with the natural daylight cycle. The appearance of depressive symptoms relates furthermore to physical health issues, medical side effects, life events and social factors, besides alcohol and substance abuse, and such factors might also potentially cause symptoms of depression in all humans. The global lifetime prevalence of depression is roughly 15%, but the incidences of episodes with a severity level not meeting the requirements for a depressive diagnosis are far more prevalent. Actigraph recordings of motor activity are considered an objective method for observing depression, although this topic is far from exhaustive studied within psychiatric research."

When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \"always prepared\" rather than \"messy\". This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche.\nThe Dataset\nThis dataset contains 1,015,342 questionnaire answers collected online by Open Psychometrics."

Its intresting to see application of AI to assist clinicians during patient treatment in a privacy preserving way. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support patients during the care process.\nOffline Reinforcement learning (also referred to as safe or batch reinforcement learning) is a promising sub-field of RL which provides us with a mechanism for solving real world sequential decision making problems where access to simulator is not available. Here we assume that learn a policy from fixed dataset of trajectories with further interaction with the environment(agent doesn't receive reward or punishment signal from the environment). It has shown that such an approach can leverage vast amount of existing logged data (in the form of previous interactions with the environment) and can outperform supervised learning approaches or heuristic based policies for solving real world - decision making problems. Offline RL algorithms when trained on sufficiently large and diverse offline datasets can produce close to optimal policies(ability to generalize beyond training data).\nAs Part of my PhD, research, I investigated the problem of developing a Clinical Decision Support System for Sepsis Management using Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning.\nMIMIC-III ('Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care') is a large open-access anonymized single-center database which consists of comprehensive clinical data of 61,532 critical care admissions from 2001–2012 collected at a Boston teaching hospital.

It can occur at any stage of pregnancy and cause problems for both the mother and the baby, during and after birth. The risks can be reduced if they are early detected and managed, especially in areas where only periodic tests of pregnant women are available. Intelligent systems designed by machine learning algorithms are remodelling all fields of our lives, including the healthcare system. This study proposes a combined prediction model to diagnose gestational diabetes. The dataset was obtained from the Kurdistan region laboratories, which collected information from pregnant women with and without diabetes."
