        "data_description": "Context\nAlthough there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.\nContent\nThe project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The individual data files have been merged together into a single data-set. On initial visual inspection of the data showed some missing values. As the data-sets were from WHO, we found no evident errors. Missing data was handled in R software by using Missmap command. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde etc. Finding all data for these countries was difficult and hence, it was decided that we exclude these countries from the final model data-set. The final merged file(final dataset) consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables was then divided into several broad categories:Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors."

These orders can be analysed and association rules can be generated using Market Basket Analysis by algorithms like Apriori Algorithm.\nApriori Algorithm\nApriori is an algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis."

The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression\nData Preparation\nSource\nThe dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.\nVariables\nEach attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors."

Our own estimate based on UN data shows the world's population surpassing 7.7 billion.\nChina is the most populous country in the world with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. It is one of just two countries with a population of more than 1 billion, with India being the second. As of 2018, India has a population of over 1.355 billion people, and its population growth is expected to continue through at least 2050. By the year 2030, the country of India is expected to become the most populous country in the world. This is because India’s population will grow, while China is projected to see a loss in population.\nThe following 11 countries that are the most populous in the world each have populations exceeding 100 million. These include the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Ethiopia, and the Philippines. Of these nations, all are expected to continue to grow except Russia and Japan, which will see their populations drop by 2030 before falling again significantly by 2050.\nMany other nations have populations of at least one million, while there are also countries that have just thousands. The smallest population in the world can be found in Vatican City, where only 801 people reside."

In the United States alone, heart disease claims roughly 647,000 lives each year — making it the leading cause of death. The buildup of plaques inside larger coronary arteries, molecular changes associated with aging, chronic inflammation, high blood pressure, and diabetes are all causes of and risk factors for heart disease.\nWhile there are different types of coronary heart disease, the majority of individuals only learn they have the disease following symptoms such as chest pain, a heart attack, or sudden cardiac arrest. This fact highlights the importance of preventative measures and tests that can accurately predict heart disease in the population prior to negative outcomes like myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) taking place.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking as three key risk factors for heart disease. Roughly half of Americans have at least one of these three risk factors. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute highlights a wider array of factors such as Age, Environment and Occupation, Family History and Genetics, Lifestyle Habits, Other Medical Conditions, Race or Ethnicity, and Sex for clinicians to use in diagnosing coronary heart disease. Diagnosis tends to be driven by an initial survey of these common risk factors followed by bloodwork and other tests."

The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented.\nIn light of what was mentioned above, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more."

According to the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.\nRigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud. They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:\na) Billing for services that were not provided.\nb) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.\nc) Misrepresenting the service provided.\nd) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided."
